# Bike_share

This is a project that I am working on that analyzes bike share data for the city of New York, and in the future other similar large scale bike share systems. 

The goal is to develop tools that will be hopefully provide insights into the overall usage of the bike share system as well as the quality of cycling infrastructure within the city. It may also be interesting for people interested in buying a bikeshare subscription or wanting to incorporate more biking into their daily lives.

This currently utilizes tools from the following sources:
